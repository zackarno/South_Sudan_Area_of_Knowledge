# SOUTH SUDAN AOK DATA PROCESSING TUTORIAL

This project was developed in January 2020 to automate South Sudan AOK data collation and analysis. This document serves as a tutorial for the the next Analyst. As this Git-hub will no longer be maintained after March 6 2020 it is recommended that this github be forked by the responsible GIS/Data Unit Manager and the fork be maintained and updated.

The actual process is mean to be implemented entirely through the script currently labeled **AOK_cleaning_aggregating.R** The markdown (rmd) file was simple made to create the tutorial and enhance documentation.

# SETUP
## packages

You will need the packages below. This analysis is dependent on the butteR package which can be downloaded from github (link below).

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zackarno/butteR")

```


```{r }
library(tidyverse)
library(butteR)
library(koboloadeR)
library(lubridate)
library(sf)
source("scripts/functions/aok_aggregation_functions.R")
source("scripts/functions/aok_cleaning_functions.R")
source("scripts/functions/aok_aggregate_by_county_wrapped.R")
```


# INPUTS
## New Settlement Data

```{r inputs}

month_of_assessment<-"2020-02-01"

admin_gdb<- "../../gis_data/gis_base/boundaries/county_shapefile"
master_settlement<-read.csv("inputs/48_December_2019/SSD_Settlements_V37.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

new_sett<-bind_rows(new_settlements)
new_sett<-new_sett %>% filter(action=="Map")

```


## Cleaning Logs
 
Once cleaning logs are revieved this chunk can be filled. First step is to compile all of the logs into one. Next we can check and implement them using the two butteR tools commented out below.
```{r}
# STEP 1 COMPILE CLEANING LOGS --------------------------------------------

# cleaning_logs<-butteR::read_all_csvs_in_folder(input_csv_folder = "inputs/2020_02/cleaning_logs")
# cleaning_log<-bind_rows(cleaning_logs)

# CHECK CLEANING LOG
# butteR::check_cleaning_log()
# butteR::implement_cleaning_log()

# OUTPUT ISSUES TO AOS

# IMPLEMENT CLEANING LOG
```


# DEALING WITH NEW SETTLEMENT DATA
## Reformatting Data/ Minor Manipulations
```{r}
# SPATIAL JOIN
new_sett_sf<-new_sett_sf %>% st_join( adm2 %>% dplyr::select(adm2=admin2RefN))

new_sett_sf<-new_sett_sf %>%
  mutate(
    new.enum_sett_county=paste0(D.info_settlement_other,D.info_county) %>% tolower_rm_special(),
    new.adm2_sett_county=paste0(D.info_settlement_other,adm2) %>% tolower_rm_special()
  )

master_settlement_sf<-master_settlement_sf %>%
  mutate(
    mast.settlement_county_sanitized= mast.NAMECOUNTY %>% tolower_rm_special()
  )
```


## Checking/Cross Referencing Settlement Data, Cleaning Logs and Assessment Data
Compare new settlements to data after initial round of data cleaning implementation too make sure that AO has not already dealt wih the settlement in the cleaning log. Technically, if the settlement is addressed in the cleaning log they should have put  "cleaning_log" under the action column in the new settlement data set.

If the settlement in the new settlement sheet has been addressed in the cleaning log, remove it from the new settlement sheet.
```{r}
# CHECK IF NEW SETTLEMENTS HAVE BEEN FIXED IN CL --------------------------

aok_clean1<-aok_raw

# aok_clean1[aok_clean1$X_uuid=="b4d97108-3f34-415d-9346-f22d2aa719ea","D.info_settlement_other"]<-NA
# aok_clean1[aok_clean1$X_uuid=="b4d97108-3f34-415d-9346-f22d2aa719ea","D.info_settlement"]<-"Bajur"


remove_from_new_sett<-aok_clean1 %>%
  filter(X_uuid %in% new_sett_sf$uuid  & is.na(D.info_settlement_other))%>%
  select(X_uuid,D.info_settlement) %>% pull(X_uuid)

new_sett_sf<- new_sett_sf %>% filter(!uuid %in% remove_from_new_sett)

```

## Exact Matches

It is possible that the enumerator entered "other" for D.new_settlement and then wrote a settlement that already existed. These cases are easy to find. If this situation occurs, it is an error during data collection/cleaning and should therefore be addressed in a cleaning log for documentation purposes. The extract_matches_to_cl to transform this information into a cleaning log, which can then be implemented with the butteR::implement_cleaning_log function.

```{r}
# NEW SETTLEMENT DATA WHICH MATCHES MASTER SETTLEMENTS EXACTLY ------------

exact_matches1<-new_sett_sf %>%
  mutate(matched_where= case_when(new.enum_sett_county %in% master_settlement$mast.settlement_county_sanitized~"enum", #CHECK WITH ENUMS INPUT
                                  new.adm2_sett_county %in% master_settlement$mast.settlement_county_sanitized~"shapefile_only" #CHECK WITH SHAEFILE COUNTY
  )) %>%
  filter(!is.na(matched_where)) #ONLY RETURN EXACT MATCHES

# WRITE EXACT MATCHES TO CLEANING LOG TO THEN IMPLEMENT ON DATA.
aok_exact_matches_cl<-exact_matches_to_cl(exact_match_data = exact_matches1,user = "Jack")

#NOW IMPLEMENT THIS CLEANING LOG!
aok_clean2<-butteR::implement_cleaning_log(df = aok_clean1,df_uuid = "X_uuid",
                                           cl = aok_exact_matches_cl,
                                           cl_change_type_col = "change_type",
                                           cl_change_col = "indicator",
                                           cl_uuid = "uuid",
                                           cl_new_val = "new_value")
```

## Finding The Closest Point

We will next use the butteR::closest_distance_rtree tool to find the closest point in the master settlement list to each of the remaining new settlements. The following code just runs this tool, cleans up the output and also performs fuzzy string distance measurement which may be helpful.

```{r}

#EXTRACT NEW SETTLEMENTS WHICH DO NO MATCH
new_sett_sf_unmatched<- new_sett_sf %>% filter(!uuid %in% exact_matches1$uuid)

#REMOVE MATCHED SETTLEMENTS FROM MASTER
master_settlement_sf_not_matched<-master_settlement_sf %>%
  filter(mast.settlement_county_sanitized %in% new_sett_sf_unmatched$new.enum_sett_county==FALSE)

# MATCH NEW SETTLEMENT TO CLOSEST SETTLEMENT IN MASTER --------------------

new_with_closest_old<-butteR::closest_distance_rtree(new_sett_sf_unmatched %>%
                                                       st_as_sf(coords=c("X","Y"), crs=4326) ,master_settlement_sf_not_matched)
#CLEAN UP DATASET
new_with_closest_old_vars<-new_with_closest_old %>%
  mutate(new.D.info_settlement_other= D.info_settlement_other %>% gsub("-","_",.)) %>%
  select(uuid,
         new.A.base=A.base,
         new.county_enum=D.info_county,
         new.county_adm2= adm2,
         new.sett_county_enum=new.enum_sett_county,
         new.sett_county_adm2= new.adm2_sett_county,
         new.D.info_settlement_other=D.info_settlement_other,
         mast.settlement=mast.NAMEJOIN,
         mast.settlement_county_sanitized,
         dist_m)



# ADD A FEW USEFUL COLUMNS - THIS COULD BE WRITTEN TO A CSV AND WOULD BE THE BEST OUTPUT TO BE REVIEWED
settlements_best_guess<-new_with_closest_old_vars %>%
  mutate(gte_50=ifelse(dist_m<500, " < 500 m",">= 500 m"),
         string_proxy=stringdist::stringdist(a =new.sett_county_enum,
                                             b= mast.settlement_county_sanitized,
                                             method= "dl", useBytes = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(dist_m,desc(string_proxy))

```
## Evaluating the closest point

The object, "settlements_best_guess,"  is the best output to review and determine if the found closest settlement in the master list should take the place of the new settlement or  not. The user has two options:

1. The less preferred option: can write this output to a csv and manually assess the the table. Add a column called "action". If the the master settlement should replace the "new settlement" put 1, otherwise 2. This file will then need to be read back into the script. Additionally, cleaning log entries will need to be added for any record in which a 1 was prescribed to action. 

2. The preferred option: The code below can be used to interactively assess the matched settlements in the R environment. When running the code in an R script a menu will prompt you through the interaction. Each line in the  settlements_best_guess will be printed with the prompt: "1. fix with master, or 2. master is not correct." The user must press 1 or two based on there understanding of the names and distances provided.  

After cycling through each record, the resulting object is a list of two data frames. The first data frame is the same list used as the input with the additional column "action" where action=1 means fix data set with new settlement and 2 means this is a new settlement. The second data frame is the auto-generated cleaning log for all records where the user decided to fix the settlement with a settlement from the master list.

```{r, eval =FALSE}

# HOWEVER, TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE R ENVIRONMENT- HERE IS AN INTERACTIVE FUNCTION TO MODIFY THE SETTLEMENT BEST GUESS DF IN PLACE
# OUTUT WILL BE A CLEANING LOG (IF THERE ARE CHANGES TO BE MADE)
new_settlement_evaluation<-evaluate_unmatched_settlements(user= "zack",new_settlement_table = settlements_best_guess)

new_settlement_evaluation$checked_setlements
new_settlement_evaluation$cleaning_log


#IN THE ACTUAL SCRIPT IF WHERE THE CLEANING LOG IS CREATED IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED HERE. HOWEVER SINCE THE CLEAING LOG CANNOT BE CREATED INTERACTIVELY WHEN THE DOCUMENT IS KNIT WE WILL NOT IMPLEMENT THE LOG
if(nrow(new_settlement_evaluation$cleaning_log>0)){
aok_clean3<-butteR::implement_cleaning_log(df = aok_clean2,df_uuid = "X_uuid",
                                           cl =new_settlement_evaluation$cleaning_log ,
                                           cl_change_type_col = "change_type",
                                           cl_change_col = "suggested_indicator",
                                           cl_uuid = "uuid",
                                           cl_new_val = "suggested_new_value")}
else{
  aok_clean3<-aok_clean2
}


```

## NEW SETTLEMENT OUTPUTS
### Generate New Itemset

Interactive functions cannot be used in a knitted document. Therefore, to fully understand this functionality the user will have to use this code in the R-Script.

For the sake of showing how to produce the new itemset for the ODK tool and producing the new master settlement list I will create the action column in R  and name it appropriately

```{r}
#this would normally be unnecessary as the objects would be created from the interactive function
#############################################################################
new_settlement_evaluation<-list()
new_settlement_evaluation$checked_setlements<-settlements_best_guess
new_settlement_evaluation$checked_setlements$action<-c(1,1,2,2,2)
#############################################################################

#THIS CLEANING LOG IMPLEMENTATION IS ACTUALLY CORRECT IN THE PREVIOUS PLACEMENT

#put into itemset format
new_sets_to_add_itemset<-new_settlement_evaluation$checked_setlements %>%
  filter(action==2) %>%
  mutate(
    list_name="settlements",
    label= new.D.info_settlement_other %>% gsub("_","-", .)
  ) %>%
  select(list_name,name=new.D.info_settlement_other, label,admin_2=new.county_adm2)

# read in previous itemset
itemset<-read.csv("inputs/tool/REACH_SSD_AoK_V38_Febuary2020/itemsets.csv", strip.white = T, stringsAsFactors = T,na.strings = c(" ",""))
itemset_not_other<-itemset %>% filter(name!="other")
itemset_other<- itemset %>% filter(name=="other")


itemset_binded<-bind_rows(list(new_sets_to_add_itemset,itemset_not_other)) %>% arrange(admin_2)
itemset_full_binded<- bind_rows(list(itemset_binded,itemset_other))


````


### Generate New Master Settlement List

Only settlements determined to be actually new settlements should be added to the master settlement list.
The following code reads the master settlement in again and adds all of the checked new settlements that are determined to be new.

```{r}
# NEXT WE ADD THE NEW SETTLEMENTS TO THE MASTER LIST
master_settlement<-read.csv("inputs/48_December_2019/SSD_Settlements_V37.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

new_setts_add_to_master<-new_settlement_evaluation$checked_setlements %>%
  filter(action==2) %>%
  mutate(
    NAME= new.D.info_settlement_other %>% gsub("_","-", .),
    NAMEJOIN= mast.settlement,
    NAMECOUNTY=paste0(NAMEJOIN,new.county_adm2),
    COUNTYJOIN= new.county_adm2 ,
    DATE= month_of_assessment %>% ymd(),
    DATA_SOURC="AOK",
    IMG_VERIFD= 0
  ) %>% #get coordinates from field data back in
  left_join(new_sett_sf %>%
              st_drop_geometry_keep_coords(), by="uuid") %>%
  filter(!is.na(X)) %>%
  select(NAME,NAMEJOIN,NAMECOUNTY,COUNTYJOIN,DATE,DATA_SOURC,IMG_VERIFD,X,Y)

master_new<-bind_rows(list(new_setts_add_to_master,master_settlement %>% mutate(DATE=dmy(DATE))))

````


# AGGREATION/ANALYSIS
## County Level Aggregation
Once the cleaning log(s) have been implemented and the new settlements dealt with it is time to aggregate/analyze the data. It is important to note that any cleaning logs generated from the new settlement process must be implemented and binded to the original compiled cleaning log for documentation purposes.

The aggregation relies on functions built many years ago. It is recommended that this process be streamlined in the future with a new script. However, for the time being I have simply wrapped the entire aggregation script inside a function that will be run in this chunk ("aok_aggregate_by_county"). This function is literally the same as the script that has been used previously for aggregating, but i have added some useful prompts/warnings. For example, when the tool changes the function will print out which columns are new and have not been added to the aggregation script/function. These columns (question/choices) need to be added to the appropriate aggregation function (i.e aok_yes,aok_mode, etc.). 

```{r}
###########################################
#ok assume we have imlpemented all cleaning
############################################
aok_clean3<-aok_clean2
iso_date<- Sys.Date() %>%  str_replace_all("-","_")
#maybe change the way assessment month is represented
aggregated_file_name<- paste0("outputs/", iso_date,"_reach_ssd_aok_data_analysis_basic_JAN2020_Data.csv")

#next start with the rmeove grouper stuff.
prev_round<-read.csv("inputs/2020_01/2020_02_13_reach_ssd_aok_clean_data_compiled.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, na.strings=c("", " ", NA, "NA"))



aok_clean_by_county<-aggregate_aok_by_county(clean_aok_data = aok_clean3,aok_previous = prev_round, current_month = month_of_assessment)
# write.csv(aok_clean_by_county,aggregated_file_name)
````


Once aggregation is completed it should be written to csv. This csv can be binded to the long term data using the long term data aggregation script. The long term data is the input for the Tableau workbook.

```{r}
# insert code here
````

## Hexagonal Aggregation
The monthly data should then be aggregated to the hexagonal grid for fact sheet  maps. The grid has already been created and can simply be loaded. I think it might be best if this portion is eventually wrrapped into a function. The only things that will change here are potentially the questions to be analyzed which can be specified/modified as vector which can be used as one of the function arguments.

It is important to note that all hexagons with >= 2 Ki and >= 2 settlements are reported on.

The chunk below does the following uses the master settlment list to add coordinates to the AOK data (which does not originally have coordinates) and performs a sptial join with the hex grid through the following steps.
1. Read in hex grid (in UTM)
2. Convert the newly generated master settlement list to a spatial object, transform to UTM (same as hex grid), and strip out the important columns.
3. Add date class columns to the clean aok data. 
4. Join master settlement to grid.
5. Merge AOK and master settlement list based on concatenated county-settlement name vector.


```{r, warning=F,message=F}
#READ IN HEX GRID
hex_grid <- st_read(dsn = "inputs/GIS",layer ="Grids_info") %>% 
  mutate( id_grid = as.numeric(rownames(.)))

master_sett_new<-master_new %>%
  mutate(id_sett = as.numeric(rownames(.))) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords=c("X","Y"), crs=4326) %>% 
  st_transform(crs=st_crs(hex_grid)) %>% 
  select(NAME:COUNTYJOIN) 

aok_clean3<-aok_clean3 %>%
  mutate(date=month_of_assessment %>% ymd(),
         month=month(date),
         year=year(date),
         #if we use D.info_settlement_final the others wont match until clean
         D.settlecounty=paste0(D.info_settlement,D.info_county)) %>%
  # therefore use D.info_settlement and filter others for tutorial
  filter(D.info_settlement!="other")

sett_w_grid <- st_join(master_sett_new, hex_grid)
assessed_w_grid <-inner_join(sett_w_grid, aok_clean3, by = c("NAMECOUNTY"="D.settlecounty") )
```

Aggregate the data to the hexagon grid-level through the following steps:
1. Calculate # KIs per settlement (D.ki_coverage)
2. Calculate the # of settlements/grid,  and # KIs/grid
3. Filter out grids with less than 2 KIs or Settlements (would be good to have citation for this rule).

```{r}
grid_summary<-assessed_w_grid %>%
  group_by(NAMECOUNTY,State_id) %>%
  summarise(D.ki_coverage=n()) %>%
  group_by(State_id) %>%
  summarise(settlement_num=n() ,ki_num=sum(D.ki_coverage) ) 
  
#Filter Grids with less than 2 KIs
grid_summary_thresholded <- grid_summary %>% filter(ki_num > 1, settlement_num > 1)
```

Next we will create composite indicators to analyze at the grid level. This may need to be edited to add or remove composite indicators later.

```{r}
#create new composites
assessed_w_grid_w_composite<-assessed_w_grid %>%
  mutate(
    idp_sites= ifelse(J.j2.idp_location=="informal_sites",1,0),
    IDP_present= ifelse(F.idp_now=="yes",1,0),
    IDP_time_arrive=  ifelse(F.f2.idp_time_arrive %in% c("1_month","3_month"),1,0),
    IDP_majority=  ifelse( F.f2.idp_perc %in% c("half","more_half"),1,0),
    food_inadequate= ifelse(G.food_now == "no", 1,0),
    less_one_meal = ifelse(G.meals_number %in% c("one", "Less_than_1"),1,0),
    hunger_severe_worse = ifelse(S.shock_hunger %in% c("hunger_severe", "hunger_worst"),1,0),
    wildfood_sick_alltime = ifelse(G.food_wild_emergency=="yes"|G.food_wild_proportion=="all",1,0),
    skipping_days = ifelse(G.food_coping_comsumption.skip_days == "yes",1,0),
    flooded_shelter = ifelse(J.shelter_flooding == "yes",1,0),
    fsl_composite = (food_inadequate +less_one_meal+hunger_severe_worse+wildfood_sick_alltime+skipping_days)/5
  )

#extract new columns added (should be only composite). You can add new composites above and this will still work
vars_to_avg<-names(assessed_w_grid_w_composite)[!names(assessed_w_grid_w_composite)%in%names(assessed_w_grid)]

analyzed_by_grid<-assessed_w_grid_w_composite %>% 
  group_by(id_grid, State_id,month,year,date,D.info_state, D.info_county)%>%
  summarise_at(vars(vars_to_avg),mean, na.rm=T)


```

Once analyzed you can write the aggreagted data to a csv or left_join it to the original hex data and write it out as a polygon straight for mapping.

```{r}
#Filter Grids with less than 2 KIs

analyzed_by_grid_thresholded<-analyzed_by_grid %>%
  filter(State_id %in% grid_summary_thresholded$State_id)

# write.csv(
  # analyzed_by_grid_thresholded,
  # file = paste0(month_of_assessment %>% str_replace_all("-","_"),"_AoK_hex_aggregations.csv"),
  # na = "NA",
  # row.names = FALSE)


hex_grid_polygon_with_aggregated_data<-hex_grid %>% left_join(analyzed_by_grid_thresholded %>% st_drop_geometry())

# or write it out to a polgon file for mapping
#using st_write function


```

# NEXT STEPS
streamline the aok_by_county agggregation function so that it does not have to be continusly edited.
